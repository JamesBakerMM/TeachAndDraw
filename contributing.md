# No New Features will be accepted without prior discussion and agreement.

TaD is focused on keeping to a small set of features. We do not want to add a large number of convenience features or edgecase features to the library. 

Over time that would make the library grow into something that defeats its original purpose of being a small api, all  of which can be taught over the course of a 12 weekish course.
