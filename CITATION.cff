  TeachAndDraw.js is a JavaScript library that has been
  developed as a teaching and learning tool and is
  deliberately simple, to minimise the mental overhead while
  learning programming. The aim of this library is to
  provide a set of easy to use functions to draw shapes and
  images onto a HTML5 Canvas, while providing support for
  loading resources, handling various native events and
  providing simple 2D physics.
